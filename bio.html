			<p>Foo Fighters was the term coined during World War 2 used to describe UFO's, and was picked up by Dave Grohl to hide his identity. Grohl wrote and recorded their debut album in 1994 as a cathartic experience to recover from the death of Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain. Following the release of the album, Grohl hired a band to perform the songs live due to record label interest. Two years later the band released their official debut album "The Colour and the Shape". Early recording sessions at the studio were poor, so the band regrouped at Dave Grohls house without drummer William Goldsmith, with Grohl sitting in on drums instead, leaving Goldsmith disgruntled, prompting him to leave the band. The singles "Monkey Wrench", "Everlong", and "My Hero" peaked in the top ten of US rock radio charts, and was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1998.</p>
			<p>"There Is Nothing Left To Lose" marks the first appearance of drummer Taylor Hawkins and the bands first Grammy win. It is often marked as a departure from the band's previous work, showing a softer sound. Their fourth studio album was released in 2002, despite troubled initial recording sessions. This tension prompted the band to redo the album from scratch at Dave Grohl's house. It is a heavier sound compared to their earlier work, meant to translate the energy of live performances. "In Your Honor" was released as a double album consisting of two discs, one containing heavy rock songs and a second disk with mellower acoustic songs. It was nominated for five Grammy awards though it did not win any.</p>

			<p>The EP "Five Songs and a Cover" was released shortly after "In Your Honor" in late 2005. Almost a year later, "Skin and Bones" was released as an acoustic album and peaked at 21 on the Billboard 200. The bands sixth studio album, "Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace", was released in 2007, and consists of regular rock and acoustic tracks. Its reception was mostly positive, though some critics thought the record was inconsistent and uninspired. It won Best Rock Album at the Grammy awards, as well as the Brit Award of Best International Album.</p>
			<p>"Wasting Light" was recorded in Grohls garage using only analog equipment in order to mimic the essence of their earlier work. It won four Grammy Awards in 2012, including Best Rock Album. It includes hit songs such as "Arlandria" and "These Days". In 2014 the band released "Sonic Highways", the production of which was documented and released as a television series on HBO. "Concrete and Gold" was released in 2017, and is described by the band as the place where "hard rock extremes and pop sensibilities collide". It draws major influence from the heated 2016 US election and the subsequent presidency of Donald Trump, as it concerns the future of the United States, the theme being "hope and desperation".</p>

			<p>Dave Grohl was the only original member of the Foo Fighters as he wrote and recorded the debut album in 1994. In 1995, Pat Smear (guitar), Nate Mendel (bass), and William Goldsmith (drums) joined Grohl. Pat Smear left the band in 1997 due to exhaustion due to the bands relentless touring. William Goldsmith left in 1997 amid drama, as the album the band was currently working on had been rerecorded cutting out Goldsmith.</p>

			<p>Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl joined the lineup in 1997, and while Hawkins became a permanent member, Stahl was released before the recording of the third studio album due to creative differences. Christopher Shiflett became the lead guitarist for the band in 1999 and has been a permanent fixture.</p>
